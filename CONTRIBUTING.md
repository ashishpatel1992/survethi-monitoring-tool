Wherever you want to implement a **new feature** or to **fix a bug**, your contribution is highly appreciated :) the workflow is **fork and pull-request**.

- Feel free to open an issue (better after searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/informatici/survethi-monitoring-tool/issues))
- Feel free to take in charge one [existing issue](https://github.com/informatici/survethi-monitoring-tool/issues)
- Use the repo's [Project](https://github.com/informatici/survethi-monitoring-tool/projects/1)

And don't forget the **'gold rules'**!

- Fork, develop & merge-request (pull-request)
- Double analyze the existing code, don't write what is already written, be DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Dumb code is better than clever one when is time to share
- Write comments when only "YOU" know what you are doing
- Optimize only after achieved
- Less is more!

Happy coding!
